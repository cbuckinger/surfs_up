Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the client, a surf-shack ice-cream deli entrepreneur, with information necessary for optimal location of his enterprise on Oahu, Hawaii.  the main considerations are to identify a site with modereate rainfall and even temperatures. 

The analysis uses temperature and precipitation data gathered by the weather reporting stations positioned throughout the island.  While the entire dataset included several years of data, our analysis focused on average daily temperatures for the two months of December 2016 and June 2017.  This report presents overview statistical summaries with a brief comparison.   

Results: 
Overall, the data showed very little variation in temperature both within and between the time periods.  December’s 71 degree mean was only six points lower than June’s; and the very low standard deviation and variance indicates that the data points occur within a fairly narrow range. Temperatures varied 12 degrees in June, and 18 in December.  Data value consistency and the lack of outliers is expressed in 0 value skewness. December had one more day of rporting than June, but this would not have an impact on the analysis.

Graphically, December shows more pronounced deviation in the first part of the histogram with few observations around 60-65 degrees, peaking at 70 degrees with the greatest number of observations.  June is fairly evenly distributed with the greatest number of observations occuring between 76 and 81 degrees.  The mode for June is 79 degrees, and 71 for December.

Summary:
The client hopes to establish his business in a location with temperate weather.  Given that he has chosen the island of Oahu, and based upon this preliminary review, this outcome seems likely.  Other factors to consider would be identifying times of year and locations which may experience conditions outside the averages in June and December, such as stong seasonal storms. One way to do this would be to run a station-by-station summary analysis and correlate those findings to actual geographic location.  Due to the nature of his business, the client is constrained in terms of geography by the need to have immediate beach access.  Plotting weather averages by month and by location could help to pin-point potential issues.
